# HOSCAD/EMS Tracking System — Changelog

## Performance, PURGE Command, Auto-Update SW, Testing Deployment (Jan 28, 2026)

### Performance Improvements (app.js)
- **Polling throttle**: Reduces polling from 10s to 60s when tab is hidden (~80% less background CPU/network)
- **Skip unchanged re-renders**: Full DOM rebuild skipped if state data (units, incidents, banners, messages) hasn't changed since last poll
- **Request overlap guard**: Prevents stacking refresh requests when Google Apps Script is slow (prevents Chrome freezing)

### Radio TONE Button — 3x Repeat (radio.js)
- **TONE button plays 3 times** with 300ms gap between repeats (was 1x)

### PURGE Command (backend + frontend)
- **PURGE** command (SUPV/STA1 only): Runs immediate data cleanup and installs daily 3 AM auto-purge trigger
- Cleans: messages >7 days, sessions >7 days inactive, audit >30 days, incident audit >30 days, closed incidents >30 days
- Backend: `apiRunPurge()` endpoint added to Code.js
- Frontend: Command added to app.js with CMD_HINTS and HELP text

### Service Worker Auto-Update (index.html, radio.html, sw.js)
- **`updateViaCache: 'none'`**: Browser always checks network for new sw.js (prevents stale cache)
- **5-minute update check**: Page proactively checks for service worker updates
- **Auto-reload on activation**: Page automatically reloads when new service worker activates — no manual Ctrl+Shift+R needed
- Cache bumped to `cadradio-v8`

### Testing Deployment Guide
- **New doc: TESTING-DEPLOYMENT.md** — instructions for deploying to `ckholden.github.io/hoscad` (separate repo, no CNAME) for testing in environments where holdenportal.com is blocked by corporate network filters
- Step-by-step: repo creation, file copy, GitHub Pages setup, update workflow

### Backend Landing Page Fix
- Updated doGet() landing page URL from `/tccad` to `/hoscad`

## Tone Policy Update, Radio Tone Change, New URL (Jan 28, 2026)

### Tone/Audio Policy Change (app.js)
- **Status board updates are now silent**: All `beepChange()` and `beepNote()` calls produce no audio — unit status changes, incident operations, logon/logoff, ridoff, undo, ok, mass dispatch, field status updates, note banners, and sender-side message confirmations no longer play tones
- **Tones preserved only for**: incoming messages (`beepMessage`), incoming urgent/HT messages (`beepHotMessage`), and alert banners (`beepAlert`) — all play `tone-urgent.wav`
- **Sender-side message tones removed**: Sending MSG, HTMSG, MSGALL, HTALL no longer plays a confirmation tone — only the recipient hears the incoming message tone via polling

### Radio Dispatch Tone Change (radio.js)
- **TONE button now sends `tone-urgent.wav`** instead of `alert-tone.mp3` (Motorola MCC7500) — radio dispatch alert uses the same triple ascending beep as HT message notifications
- Updated `_loadToneChunks()` to fetch `tone-urgent.wav` instead of `alert-tone.mp3`

### New URL: holdenportal.com/hoscad
- **Frontend deployed to `/hoscad`** directory on GitHub Pages (previously `/tccad`)
- **Site navigation updated**: Main holdenportal.com nav now includes HOSCAD and CADRadio links
- Old `/tccad` path also updated and still functional

### Service Worker Update
- Bumped cache to `cadradio-v7` to pick up tone file change
- Added `app.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` to APP_SHELL cache list

### DEPLOYMENT.md Updated
- Reflects new `/hoscad` path, includes all tone files in deploy script, documents audio/tone policy

## Address Lookup, INFO Contacts, DEST Command, Audio Fixes, Radio LO (Jan 28, 2026)

### Address/Facility Lookup System
- **Backend**: New "Addresses" sheet with 97 facility entries (hospitals, urgent care, SNFs, fire stations, LE, jails, airports, air ambulance, dialysis centers)
- **Columns**: addr_id, name, address, city, state, zip, category, aliases, phone, notes
- **API endpoint**: `getAddresses(token)` returns all addresses for client-side caching
- **Client-side fuzzy search**: 3-tier matching (exact alias → starts-with → contains) across id, name, aliases, address, city
- **Custom autocomplete dropdown**: Replaces native `<datalist>` on destination inputs in unit modal and new incident modal
- **Dropdown features**: Keyboard navigation (arrows/enter/escape), mouse selection, shows `[ID] NAME — ADDRESS, CITY [CATEGORY]`
- **Board rendering**: Recognized addresses show in green with full address tooltip on hover
- **Incident queue/review**: Resolved facility names instead of raw IDs
- **ADDR command**: `ADDR` shows full directory grouped by category; `ADDR <query>` searches addresses
- **Storage convention**: Facility ID (e.g., "SCB") stored as destination value, resolved to display name on frontend

### INFO Command — Dispatch & Emergency Contacts
- **INFO** (bare): Shows quick reference with Central Oregon dispatch numbers
- **INFO DISPATCH**: DCSO, Redmond, Bend, La Pine, Prineville, Madras, Warm Springs dispatch numbers
- **INFO AIR**: Air ambulance — AirLink, Life Flight, CalStar base numbers
- **INFO OSP**: Oregon State Police dispatch and field numbers
- **INFO CRISIS**: Deschutes County crisis line, suicide hotline, 988, poison control
- **INFO POISON**: Oregon Poison Center direct line
- **INFO ROAD**: ODOT trip check and road conditions
- **INFO LE**: Law enforcement non-emergency numbers (Bend PD, Redmond PD, DCSO, Prineville PD, etc.)
- **INFO JAIL**: Deschutes, Crook, Jefferson county jail numbers
- **INFO FIRE**: Fire agency non-emergency numbers (Bend, Redmond, La Pine, Sunriver, Cloverdale, Crooked River Ranch)
- **INFO ME**: Oregon State Medical Examiner
- **INFO OTHER**: COCC campus safety, ODFW, Humane Society
- **INFO ALL**: Shows all categories
- Added to CMD_HINTS and HELP text

### DEST Command — Set Unit Location from Command Line
- **DEST <UNIT>; <LOCATION>**: Sets unit destination/location
- Resolves location against address lookup (getById → single search match → freeform text)
- Example: `DEST EMS1; SCB` resolves to recognized address "SCB"
- Example: `DEST EMS1; 1234 Main St` stores freeform text

### Auto-Copy Incident Destination to Unit
- When a unit is assigned to an incident via status command (D/DE with incident), the incident's destination is automatically copied to the unit's destination field

### Audio System Overhaul (app.js + radio.html)
- **Replaced all synthesized oscillators** with pre-rendered WAV audio files — eliminates harsh/clicky tones on mobile and desktop
- **Generated 5 WAV tone files** via Node.js (`generate-tones.js`): tone-change, tone-note, tone-message, tone-alert, tone-urgent
- **All notifications use `tone-urgent.wav`**: triple ascending beep (700→880→1047Hz) with warm harmonics and smooth envelope
- **Motorola MCC 7500 alert tone** (`alert-tone.mp3`): used exclusively by radio TONE button
- **Audio unlock on user gesture**: silent audio play on first touchstart/mousedown/keydown for mobile compatibility
- **Radio.html**: uses same `tone-urgent.wav` for urgent message alerts

### CADRadio Updates (radio.html)
- **LO command**: Typing `LO` or `LOGOUT` in radio command bar logs out of CAD, cleans up Firebase, returns to login screen
- **Address lookup**: Loads facility addresses via API after login and on auto-reconnect
- **Destination resolution**: Incident display, poll updates, and review (R) command show resolved facility names instead of raw IDs
- **HELP updated**: Added LO to command reference

### DEST Command — No Confirmation Popup
- Removed `showAlert()` popup after setting destination — just beeps and refreshes board

### LO Command Fix (radio.html)
- Wrapped logout chain in async IIFE with try/catch so `showLogin()` always runs even if API calls fail

### Service Worker Update
- Bumped cache from `cadradio-v4` to `cadradio-v6` to force refresh of stale cached files
- Added `radio.html` and all WAV tone files to APP_SHELL pre-cache list

### Desktop App Cache Fix
- Added `session.defaultSession.clearCache()` on startup to both HOSCAD and CADRadio Electron apps
- Ensures hosted web app updates (tones, code) load fresh on every launch

### Deployment
- All changes deployed to GitHub Pages (`holdenportal.com/tccad`)
- Backend deployed via clasp (Apps Script version @85+)
- Alert tone MP3 deployed for radio TONE button use

## Board Visuals, Night Mode, Command Hints, CADRadio Field Features (Jan 27, 2026)

### Phase A: Board Visual Improvements
- **Status badge pills**: Board status column shows colored pill (D=blue, DE=yellow, OS=red, T=purple, AV=green, etc.) followed by label text
- **Expanded stale detection**: D, DE, OS, T statuses now trigger stale warnings (was OS only). Stale banner groups by status: `"STALE D (>=30M): JC | STALE OS (>=30M): EMS1"`
- **Row hover accent**: Blue left-border highlight on board row hover with CSS transition
- **Incident type dots**: Units with incidents show a colored dot (medical=red, trauma=orange, fire=red-orange, hazmat=purple, rescue=blue) next to the INC# on the board

### Phase B: Command Bar Autocomplete
- **CMD hints dropdown**: Typing in the command bar shows matching command suggestions (max 5)
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate hints, Enter to select, Escape to close
- **24 common commands**: D, DE, OS, T, AV, OOS, BRK, F, V, SORT, DEN, NIGHT, NC, R, UH, MSG, LOGON, LOGOFF, PRESET, CLR, HELP

### Phase C: Night Mode
- **NIGHT command**: Toggles dim display (brightness 0.65, saturation 0.8) on main content
- **Toolbar button**: NIGHT button in toolbar bar, highlights when active
- **Persists**: Saved in VIEW state via localStorage, applied on page load
- **Modals excluded**: Dialogs remain at full brightness

### Phase D: CADRadio Field Improvements
- **Status update buttons** (radio.html): ENROUTE, ON SCENE, TRANSPORT, AVAILABLE buttons push status to Firebase `cadradio/statusUpdates`. Dispatcher CAD auto-applies the change with a brief notification banner.
- **Preset message buttons** (radio.html): 10-4, ENROUTE, ON SCENE, NEED HELP, TRANSPORT, CLEAR — one-tap message send
- **Incident info display** (radio.html): Shows active incident assignment (INC#, destination, type, note) from Firebase `cadradio/fieldAssignments/{callsign}`
- **Field assignment writer** (app.js): Dispatching a unit (D/DE) writes assignment to Firebase; setting AV clears it

### Phase E: UI/UX Tweaks
- **Status summary bar**: Added DE, T, F, BRK counts. Each count is clickable to filter the board. Added `quickFilter()` function.
- **Mobile PTT**: `@media (max-width: 600px)` enlarges PTT buttons (20px padding, 16px font). `@media (max-width: 400px)` switches to single-column channel grid.

### Deployment
- Updated DEPLOYMENT.md with full GitHub Pages deploy process (copy + git push)
- Deployed all frontend files including radio.html, radio.js, manifests, service worker, icons
